    "> He stretched himself and scratched his thigh where a mosquito had bitten him while he slept. Another one was wailing near his ear. He slapped the ear and hoped he had killed it. \"Why do they always go for one's ears?\" When he was a child, his mother had told him a story about it. Mosquito, she had said, had asked Ear to marry him, whereupon Ear fell on the floor in uncontrollable laughter. \"How much longer do you think you will live?\" she asked. \"You are already a skeleton!\" Mosquito went away humiliated; and anytime he passed her way, he told Ear that he was still alive.
